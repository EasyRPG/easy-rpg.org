# Exclude files/directories from updating by rsync.
# This is useful for keeping unversioned files in place.

# The automatic homepage update timer / jenkins trigger will not
# delete files by default, so a manual run is required periodically.
# e.g. /usr/local/bin/update-homepage.sh [dryrun] delete
