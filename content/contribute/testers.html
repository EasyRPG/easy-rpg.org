	<h2>Testers</h2>
	<p>
		EasyRPG uses a RPG Maker 2000 test game project to see
		which RPG Maker 2000 features are working fine in
		EasyRPG Player. This game consists on a collection of
		maps with some tests inside, e.g.: a map with a lot of
		characters with "Show Message" command tests with all
		features (character limits, colors, speed...) of the
		show message event commands.

		This game can be played and compared by any person
		without specific programming knowledge, only needing a
		copy of RPG Maker 2000 game interpreter (RPG_RT.exe)
		to play with it, then compare with EasyRPG player and
		report any emulation difference between them.

	<h4>Reporting EasyRPG Readers library defects</h4>
	<p>
		The easiest method to detect RPG Maker 2000/2003 file
		format issues is by downloading the LCF2XML tool and
		compare generated XML information with the existing in
		project database. Also, LCF2XML can convert back XML to
		the native RPG Maker 2000/2003 file format and do a
		binary comparison between them. Also, you can generate
		again XML files for text comparison for easier
		information loss detection.
