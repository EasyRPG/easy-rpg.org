	<h2>Translators</h2>
	<p>
		Currently, only the Android port of EasyRPG Player has proper translation support. However,
		there is no central place to submit translations to. This will hopefully be fixed in the future.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the meanwhile, you can download and translate the
		<a href="https://github.com/EasyRPG/Player/blob/master/builds/android/res/values/strings.xml">raw strings file</a>
		in your native language and submit it to us.<br />
		We currently have maintainers for French, German and Spanish language.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are no additional texts ready and pending to be translated, but there will be later,
		for example for this information website or for EasyRPG Editor.
		Please come back later.
