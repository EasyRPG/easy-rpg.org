	<h2>Translators</h2>
	<p>
		Currently, only the Android port of EasyRPG Player has proper translation support.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can translate the strings to your native language online or download them for offline
		translation over at <a href="https://www.transifex.com/easyrpg/player-android/">Transifex</a>,
		then submit it to us.<br />
		You can do so through Transifex (preferred) or create a pull request for the raw 'strings.xml'
		file over at GitHub.
	</p>
	<p>
		We currently have maintainers for French, German and Spanish language.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are no additional texts ready and pending to be translated currently, but there will
		be later, for example for this information website or for EasyRPG Editor.
		Please come back later.
